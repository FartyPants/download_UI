put it in your text-generation-webui folder where download-model.py is
It mimics the action of downloading models in Model tab to Models folder, but without the entire text genration webUI interface.
It also starts on a port 1 higher than WebUI -  the idea is so you can run both - for example when your oobabooga interface is busy training etc... you can still download in next tab.
