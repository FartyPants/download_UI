# download_UI
A simple Gradio interface for download of hugginface models

put it in your text-generation-webui folder.
It mimics the action of downloading models to Models folder, but without the text genration webUI interface
It also starts on a port 1 higher than WebUI -  the idea is so you can run both - for example when your oobabooga interface is busy training etc...
